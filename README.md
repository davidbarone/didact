# didact
Tiny React clone based on the original Didact library which can be found at: https://github.com/pomber/didact

The original Didact is a tiny React-like library used for educational purposes. The full article can be found at: https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/. This is my copy of didact which has also been published to npm so can be used directly in my personal projects.

Note: if you're looking for the original Didact, please go to https://www.npmjs.com/package/didact

The original Didact source code has been slightly modified here as follows:
1. Conversion to TypeScript and split into multiple files for improved readability.
2. Inclusion of tests

This is also being used as a training project for the following:
1. Test publishing packages to npm
2. Creating a full reference application for npm packages, including:
   1. Code in TypeScript
   2. use of Bundler (WebPack) in the build process
   3. Testing the package locally
