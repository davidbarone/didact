# didact
Tiny React clone from https://github.com/pomber/didact

Didact is a tiny React variant used for educational purposes. The full article can be found at: https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/. This is my copy of didact which has also been published to npm so can be used directly in my personal projects.
