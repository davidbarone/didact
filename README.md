# didact
Tiny React clone from https://github.com/pomber/didact

Didact is a tiny React variant used for educational purposes. The full article can be found at: https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/. This is my copy of didact which has also been published to npm so can be used directly in my personal projects.

The original Didact source code has been slightly modified as follows:
1. Conversion to TypeScript and split into multiple files for improved readability.
2. Inclusion of tests

This is also being used as a training project for the following:
1. Test publishing packages to npm
2. Creating a full reference application for npm packages, including:
   1. Code in TypeScript
   2. use of Bundler (WebPack) in the build process
   3. Testing the package locally
